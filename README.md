# Advance-Excel-Work
Here are the files that I worked on using my advanced excel knowledge

Info about files:
  1) I have worked on USA store data to create MIS report/interactive dashboard on it , which describes the store sales, employee, market situation in details.
  
  2) Another file contains problem statements for a company named 'Kapiva'. I have tried to resolve problems and provide insights using advance excel functions like SUMIF(), COUNTIFS(), Vlookup(), Conditional Formatting, Delimiting, Using combined formulas etc.
